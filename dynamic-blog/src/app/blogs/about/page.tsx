My Journey as a Beginner in Web Development
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4 font-sans text-start">
          As a beginner in web development, I&apos;m excited to start my journey of
          building dynamic and responsive websites that offer both functionality
          and a great user experience. Over the past few months, Ive been
          learning the essentials of frontend and backend development, and each
          project I work on helps me grow and build my skills. I&apos;m passionate
          about exploring new technologies and improving my understanding of how
          the web works. 
          <br/>
          Through this blog, I aim to share my learning, tips,
          and experiences with others who are also starting out. I&apos;m always open
          to connecting with fellow learners and professionals to collaborate,
          share ideas, or discuss new tech trends. Let&apos;s build something amazing
          together!
